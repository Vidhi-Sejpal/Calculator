            On 5th October, 2019,. A workshop on AR was conducted by Team ISTE at B-110 , KJSCE. Augmented Reality is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in realtime. Unlike virtual reality which creates totally artificial environment, Augmented reality uses the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it. The session was conducted by 3 experts - <b>Vishal,Rishabh And Ronit.</b> Students were asked to install three softwares that were required(Blender,Unity and Android Studio). Students were able to grasp the concept easily. Good response was received from students.

          On 5th September, 2018,. A workshop on scientific calculator and component testing workshop was conducted at B-407 , KJSCE. This workshop was specially for first year students , it was even open for second students. It helped these students to know all the functions of Scientific Calculator for all the subjects in this semester as well as in coming semesters. The Components testing part helped the students to know how the circuit works as well as how we can practically mount any type of circuit and also the use of function generator and CRO . With the help of this they understood the circuits and how to mount circuits .
