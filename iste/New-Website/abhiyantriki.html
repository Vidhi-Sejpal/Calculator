          The growls of the Minotaur can be heard ringing through the narrow pavements of the labyrinth, as your bot makes it's​ way inside. Using a smartphone/remote, the participant has to *control a bot* inside a labyrinth filled with the unknown till it reaches an escape​.
          The only way you can make sense of the inside is through a *live stream.*
          Do you have what it takes to face the terrors that lie inside? (Bots will be provided - Just Run the bot & conquer it like 'tomb raider')

            Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE) conducted an amazing event by the name of ‘ROBOSPRINT’. 
            The event was divided into three parts. The first part consisted of physical obstacles for the bot to overcome. This part also consisted of a simple problem related to mechanics. The next part consisted of coding. Participants had to get the output for the given problem statement in a time span of 30 minutes. The last part of the event had circuit building at its core. The participants had to assemble the given circuit of line follower bot and then using the same bot had to reach the finish line. A total of 20 minutes was allotted for completion of this task. The participants completing all the three tasks in the shortest time were adjudged the winners of the event.
            A total of 20 teams participated in the event.
            The success of the event can be attributed to sheer hardwork and dedication of all the team members. The extensive publicity by the PR team, the combined efforts of the event and technical team to get the track together on time and the excellent work of the creative team in getting the posters as well as the delicate portions of the track ready on time. These factors combined to make the event hugely successful.

In Coding lane all the task will be related to coding. The coding will be in either in “C or Java”. Task will be given on die roll. All these task will be done in computer lab. This round will be of 30 mins. Electronic Lane After Coding lane the participants will reach “Silicon valley”. In Electronics lane all the task will be related to electronics. Task will be given on die roll. All these task will be done in a room. Each task will be of 30 mins.<br>
